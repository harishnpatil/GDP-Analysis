# GDP-Analysis
 This project analyzes GDP data from 1960 to 2016 using Python in Jupyter Notebook. It visualizes individual country trends, compares GDPs across nations and with global GDP, and automates report generation for 256 countries. Missing data and outliers were addressed, ensuring accurate, comprehensive insights.
Key Features:
* Country-wise GDP Analysis: For each country, we analyzed the GDP data separately, generating graphs to highlight individual trends over the years.
* Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we visualized the GDP data and saved the graphs to the desktop.
* GDP Comparisons: We performed comparisons between the GDPs of different countries and also compared each country's GDP with the global GDP.
* Automation: The project includes automated code that generates individual analysis reports for 256 countries present in the dataset.
* Data Cleaning: We handled outliers and missing data, ensuring that the dataset was accurate and up-to-date for analysis.
